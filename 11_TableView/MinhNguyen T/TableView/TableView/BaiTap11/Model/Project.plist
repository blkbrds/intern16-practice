	<string>Project1: Table views on iOS display a single column of vertically scrolling content, divided into rows. Each row in the table contains one piece of your appâ€™s content. </string>
	<string>Project2: For example, the Contacts app displays the name of each contact in a separate row, and the main page of the Settings app displays the available groups of settings. You can configure a table to display a single long list of rows, or you can group related rows into sections to make navigating the content easier.</string>
	<string>Project3: Tables are commonly used by apps whose data is highly structured or organized hierarchically. Apps that contain hierarchical data often use tables in conjunction with a navigation view controller, which facilitates navigation between different levels of the hierarchy.</string>
	<string>Project4: UITableView manages the basic appearance of the table, but your app provides the cells (UITableViewCell objects) that display the actual content. The standard cell configurations display a simple combination of text and images, but you can define custom cells that display any content you want. You can also supply header and footer views to provide additional information for groups of cells.</string>
